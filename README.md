Here's what I accomplished:

✅ Provisioned an EC2 instance with a custom AMI
✅ Attached a security group allowing traffic on port 8080
✅ Deployed a lightweight HTTP server using BusyBox
✅ Served a custom HTML page using Terraform's user_data

🔧 Tools Used:

Terraform (IaC)

AWS EC2, VPC, Security Groups

Shell scripting

BusyBox web server

🌐 I accessed the server using the public IP and verified the content served on port 8080!

This hands-on experience helped strengthen my understanding of Infrastructure as Code, cloud provisioning, and automating deployments. 💪
